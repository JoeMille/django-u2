  <h2>About Penny Miller</h2>
  <p>Penny Miller is a British born canine behavior counsellor who had a come to Jesus moment 
  when she witnessed a local English dog trainer she had hired to train her naughty dog Nelson, 
  use a choke chain to almost strangle him into submission. 
  Right after she threatened to lay the guy out, (yeah, she’s like that), she enlisted the services 
  of British dog behaviorist Dr. Kendall Shepherd who taught her a different, kinder way of looking 
  at behavior problems, and the decision was made there and then to pursue this further. 
  Years of study in dog psychology and behavior, both in college, and later, with world renowned 
  trainers like John Rogerson, Patricia McConnell, Michael Shikashio, Ken McCort, and Suzanne 
  Clothier to name but a few, have provided Penny with a uniquely empathic approach to dog behavior 
  and handling but, she says, her greatest and most intense period of learning was always and will 
  always be her work with shelter dogs. </p>

  <h2>From the Author...<i class="fas fa-pen"></i></h2>
  <p>Talking to your vet and researching everything that you put inside, and on, your dog’s body is the safest 
    course of action in any instance.
    Just try and find a vet who is willing to discuss natural alternatives with you and who has taken the time to 
    understand the benefits of homeopathy where appropriate. 
    Lastly, this book is written in layman’s terms very intentionally.
    I fall asleep reading things that are just lists after lists of scientific data and much prefer to be ‘grabbed and 
    entertained’ by more anecdotal evidence in the first instance, which spurs me on to follow it up and do further research. 
    I make no secret of the fact that, despite my formal education, I have always done my best learning hands on; my work with 
    literally thousands of dogs over the years at both our boarding facility and our senior dog rescue sanctuary has given me 
    amazing opportunities to see what has worked….and what hasn’t. 
    I hope this book spurs you on to dig deeper into areas you may not have had the inclination, or the confidence, to look at before and 
    I pray that your beloved senior dog reaps the benefits, big style!
